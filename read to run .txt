please read this file to understand how the code works and how to run it
the createdata1 .ipynb is jupyter file that i used to create the first 2 tables and the database
the create test data.ipynb is file we used to create test_data table in to our data base my_data.db 
1- our first objectuve is  to find the ideal fucntions so we did run our first part of the data which is combined of database.py, visualization.py, preanalysis.py, premain.py 
2- after we run our premain.py we found the best functions as following : Best functions selected: ['y48', 'y44', 'y50', 'y2']
3- now we run the sedonc part of the code which is combined of main.py, analysis.py visualization.py, database.py.
and then a window shows up to visualize the data points

to run the tests use the following command : python -m unittest discover -s test
